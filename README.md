This repository contains the programs which solve the PyBank and PyPlot problems for the week 3 homework.
## PyBank
>This program reads in a file which contains profit and loss information from a csv in the Resources folder.
It calculates the change in the recorded profit and loss from month-to-month.
It then calculates the average change and the largest increase and the largest decrease.
Finally it formats the output and prints it to the terminal and into a .txt file in the analysis folder.
